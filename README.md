# lampkeeper
The lampkeeper is a terminal-based exploration game where you control a lamplighter (lampkeeper) navigating a dark 12x12 grid. Your goal is to light up lamps, break through obstacles, and reveal at least half of the map to win — all while making strategic moves with limited visibility.
